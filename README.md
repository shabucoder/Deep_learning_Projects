# Deep_learning_Projects

This repository is dedicated to my journey of building one machine learning or deep learning model each day to deepen my understanding of algorithms and architectures. The goal is to explore, implement, and analyze a diverse range of models, from foundational ones like linear regression and basic neural networks to advanced architectures such as Transformers and GANs
